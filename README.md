# Kairos Java Library
### Overview
This library offers a Java wrapper for Kairos Recognition Api. The biggest difference to the existing Android/Java Library linked on Kairos are:

- Synchronous Http Client
- Full parsing and OO representation of the incoming results
- Supports latest Api changes mentioned in the Kairos changelog, even if not represented in api docs
    - @Kairos PLEASE keep your api, documentation, examples and Api blueprint consistent and up to date!

If I got time I'll add the Emotions Api following my pattern later, but for now there is already one available, you can find in repositories of kairosinc.

For now JavaDoc is missing, so have a look at kairos.io for api docs. Am busy writing Bachelor-Thesis right now, so just buildt library as I need it, documentation delayed ;)

#### Please feel free to recommend any improvements or create PRs (also for documentation).
